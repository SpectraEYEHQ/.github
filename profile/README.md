## Integrations
Plug Spectra EYE into the tools your team already uses.

- **Chat & Collaboration:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, Webex  
- **Email & Inbound Parse:** SendGrid (templates & inbound)

- **SDKs:** Official client libraries (see below)  
- **SSO (planned):** Google/Microsoft SSO, SAML

## Quick Start

> **Option A: SaaS** — Sign in, create your first monitor, and invite your team.  
> **Option B: Self-host (advanced)** — Use the backend (PHP) and SPA frontend (React + Vite).

**Requirements (self-host):**
- PHP 8.2+ with extensions commonly used for APIs
- MySQL 8+
- Node.js 20+ (for the SPA frontend)
- A reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) with HTTPS

**High-level steps:**
1. Deploy backend API and configure database connection.  
2. Build & deploy SPA frontend (or use the hosted frontend).  
3. Create an organization, invite users, set roles.  
4. Add monitors/heartbeats and configure alert channels.  
5. Publish your public status page.

## API & SDKs

### Heartbeat Example
Trigger a heartbeat from a service on success (any HTTP method supported):

```bash
curl -X GET "https://<your-host>/api/v1.1/heartbeat/<YOUR_HEARTBEAT_TOKEN>"
```

Add metadata (optional):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<your-host>/api/v1.1/heartbeat/<YOUR_HEARTBEAT_TOKEN>"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"job":"nightly-backup","status":"ok","duration_ms":5321}'
```

### Monitors (Example Concepts)
- URL availability & latency
- SSL cert expiry window
- DNS resolution
- TCP/UDP checks

## Roadmap
- Advanced SLOs (burn rate alerts)  
- Synthetic journeys & multi-step checks  
- Deeper integrations (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Jira)  
- Native SSO (OIDC/SAML)  
- Terraform provider & CLI
